Features:
Shuffled Deck: A randomized deck with four suits and 13 ranks, reshuffled before each game.
Gameplay Simulation: Simple simulation of Blackjack where you play against the dealer.
OOP Structure: Organized into Card, Deck, and other modular classes for better scalability and code management.
Card Representation: Cards are displayed in the format “Rank of Suit” (e.g., Ace of Hearts).

How to Play:
The player is dealt two cards, and the dealer is dealt two cards (one hidden).
The player can choose to "Hit" (get another card) or "Stand" (end their turn).
The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
After the player stands, the dealer reveals their hidden card and continues to hit until their total is 17 or higher.
The player wins if their hand value is higher than the dealer’s, without exceeding 21.
